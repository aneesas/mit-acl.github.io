We research topics related to autonomous systems and control design for aircraft, spacecraft, and ground vehicles. Theoretical research is pursued in areas such as: 

* Decision making under uncertainty
* Path planning, activity, and task assignment
* Estimation and navigation
* Robust control, adaptive control, and model predictive control
* Machine learning and reinforcement learning methods
