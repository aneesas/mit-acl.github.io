I am a graduate student in the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/) in Applied Ocean Science and Engineering. I am pursuing the development of a multi-robot system that can autonomously explore and build semantics maps of environments, such as the ocean, where communication is limited. I am co-supervised by [Dr. Yogesh Girdhar](http://warp.whoi.edu/).
