### About

Manipulation using UAVs require an extraordinary precise control. In this project, we propose the use of a Hexacopter with canted motors to extract and insert a plate in a very tight space. With the canted motors we are able to decouple the translation and rotation dynamics of the UAV, which increases significantly the precision in these manipulation tasks.
