This project is aimed at developing a new approach to decentralized exploration that takes into account the communication constraints imposed by physical separation among agents. Recent research has focused on finding ways to maximize the amount of information that may be shared among agents, both by controlling them in such a way as to maximize their available communication bandwidth while still accomplishing the desired sensing task, and also by utilizing available bandwidth efficiently in order to achieve high information gain.
