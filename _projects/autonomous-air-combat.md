Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have the potential to perform many of the complex and possibly dangerous missions currently own by manned aircraft. Within visual range air combat is a particularly difficult and dynamic aerial task which presents many challenges for an autonomous UAS. This project focuses on formulating and solving a function approximation dynamic program to provide maneuvering decisions for autonomous one-on-one air combat. Micro UAS are used at MIT's Real-time indoor Autonomous Vehicle test ENvironment (RAVEN) to implement and test the planning algorithms.
