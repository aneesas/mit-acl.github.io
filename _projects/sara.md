### About

ACL is part of the MIT team that participates in the [ARL SARA program (cycle 2)](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/cras/sara-cra/). The goal of the project is to achieve autonomous navigation in complex off-road environments. To this end, the ACL team has proposed several approaches for uncertainty-aware traversability learning and risk-aware planning:
* [Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability Learning](https://acl.mit.edu/projects/cai24-pietra)
* [EVORA: Deep EVidential Traversability Learning for Risk-Aware Off-Road Autonomy](https://acl.mit.edu/projects/cai24-evora)
* [RAMP: A Risk-Aware Mapping and Planning Pipeline for Fast Off-Road Ground Robot Navigation](https://acl.mit.edu/projects/sharma23-ramp)
* [Risk-Aware Off-Road Navigation via a Learned Speed Distribution Map](https://acl.mit.edu/projects/cai22-learned-traversability)
