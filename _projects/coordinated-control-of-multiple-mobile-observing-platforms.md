description: This research addresses targeting of multiple sensor platforms in the context of numerical weather prediction. This work has proposed a computationally effective information-theoretic approach that determines the best sensing points to reduce the forecast uncertainty in the region of interest, with further consideration of robustness and decentralzation aspects.
